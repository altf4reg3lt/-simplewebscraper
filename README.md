# -simplewebscraper
This is an example for a very simple and easy Version of a webscraper written in javascript and using npmjsp


First of all you need node js and some Packages

You can download all Packages at https://www.npmjs.com/package/package
What Packages you need:

1.nodemon
2.axios
3.cheerio
4.express


After you installed all these Packages you are not that far from scraping your target website

In index.js youÂ´ll first need to enter a target website and then from the website the field
you want to scrape.


The final step is to open a terminal or cmd type in: npm run start



As I said this one of the simplest scraper you can make it even more advanced and customize it for your own wishes.


I hope you enjoy it :)
